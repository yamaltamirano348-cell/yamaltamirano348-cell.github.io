<h2>Contract</h2>

<p>
I, <a href="introduction.html">Yamilet Altamirano</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2026 WEB115 course
with my instructor, Instructor Saxena.
</p>

<p>
I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world.
I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
</p>

<p>
I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
</p>

<p>
